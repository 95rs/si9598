A group of Windows 95 and 98 icons.

## Info:
This is a repo full of [.ico files](/icons/ico-files/) and [.png files](/icons/png-files/) that are icons from Windows 95 or Windows 98.

To convert the `.ico` icons to `.png` I used a [Python](https://python.org) script located in the [icons folder](/icons/) called [convert.py](/icons/convert.py).
This script will work on any `.ico` files as long as they fit this critera:
- The script must be in a folder with 2 other folders named inside it.
    - One folder must be empty and named `png-files`
    - The second folder must have at least one `.ico` file (any `.ico` file will still be converted in subfolders of the `ico-files` folder.)

## Icons:
All of the icons in the `.ico` format are in the [ico-files](/icons/ico-files/) folder.
All of the icons in the `.png` format are in the [png-files](/icons/png-files/) folder.

And of course I didn't make these icons. Neither did the people who posted them.
Microsoft owns all of the rights to these icons because they made them.
