A group of Windows 95 and 98 icons.

## Info:
This is a repo full of [.ico files](/icons/ico-files/) and [.png files](/icons/png-files/) that are icons from Windows 95 or Windows 98.

## Icons:
All of the icons in the `.ico` format are in the [ico-files](/icons/ico-files/) folder.
All of the icons in the `.png` format are in the [png-files](/icons/png-files/) folder.

And of course I didn't make these icons. Neither did the people who posted them.
Microsoft owns all of the rights to these icons because they made them.
